<p>Grains are small, hard, dry seeds, with or without attached hulls or
fruit layers, harvested for human or animal consumption. The two main
types of commercial grain crops are cereals such as wheat and rye, and
legumes such as beans and soybeans.

<p>After being harvested, dry grains are more durable than other staple
foods such as starchy fruits such as plantains and breadfruit and tubers such
as sweet potatoes and cassava. This durability has made grains well suited
to industrial agriculture, since they can be mechanically harvested,
transported by rail or ship, stored for long periods in silos, and milled
for flour or pressed for oil.</p>
